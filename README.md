# developer_junk

a place to dump linter settings, scripts, whatever



# how 2 lint:

1) npm install eslint 
2) Sublime: Command+Shift+P ==> Install Packages ==> SublimeLinter
3) Sublime: Command+Shift+P ==> Install Packages ==> SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint
4) create a .eslintrc.js in your home directory... (I think techially has to be up the directory tree from the file you're trying to lint, so depends on where your workspace is I guess)
5) restart sublime
6) right click > lint stuff
